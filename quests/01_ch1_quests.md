## Chapter 1 Day 1

### CH1D1 Quest 1: Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words
Blockchain is an open, decentralized network that copy pasta data with each other and verify whether the data and changes to the data are correct.

### CH1D1 Quest 2: Explain what a Smart Contract is
Smart Contracts are a way to store code on the blockchain and interact with the code.

### CH1D1 Quest 3: Explain the difference between a script and a transaction
Scripts are used to read data from a smart contract on the Flow Blockchain. Read-only. Does not require gas fees.
Transactions are used to call functions from a smart contract which change data on the blockchain. Transactions require paying for gas fees.

## Chapter 1 Day 2

### CH1D2 Quest 1: What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
1. Safety and Security
2. Clarity
3. Approachability
4. Developer Experience
5. Resource Oriented Programming

### CH1D2 Quest 2: In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

1. Safety and Security: We want to prevent exploits in our contracts and thereby securing our digital assets.
2. Clarity: Explicit design and readability allows for efficient reviewing of smart contract code which give the benefits of development speed and cost-savings.
3. Approachability: By having simple syntax and semantics it becomes easy for developers to get started on a new language such as Cadence quickly.
4. Developer Experience: Great dev tools helps speed up the development process and help making sure that the code works as intended. This leads to more blockchain applications being launched fast.
5. Resource Oriented Programming: Resources are different from objects that are seen in Object Oriented Programming in the sense that you want to make sure that resources are not accidentally lost nor duplicated. Building applications for digital assets with a resource oriented programming language helps enforce asset security.
